Sure! Here you go:

**1. How do I approach designing software?**
I usually start by figuring out what the software needs to do and breaking it down into smaller, manageable pieces. I try to keep things simple at first and focus on the main goals before adding extra details.

**2. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
This project helped me get better at organizing my code into reusable parts like functions, which made it easier to make changes without breaking everything.

**3. What design process did you follow for your project work?**
I began by planning out the scene and deciding which objects to create first. Then I worked on each part step by step, testing along the way to fix problems early.

**4. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
Breaking down work into small steps and testing often will help me avoid getting overwhelmed and make fixing mistakes less stressful in future projects.

**5. How do I approach developing programs?**
I try to write a basic version that works first, then improve and add features gradually instead of aiming for perfection right away.

**6. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
I started using layering textures and making reusable functions for objects so I wouldn’t have to write the same code over and over.

**7. How did iteration factor into your development?**
Iteration was important because I tried different textures and object placements multiple times before settling on what looked best.

**8. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?**
Over time, I got better at planning my steps and cleaning up my code, which made finishing the project easier and less stressful.

**9. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
Computer science teaches me problem-solving skills and how to build tools that can make work easier or open up new chances in my career.

**10. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
They help me understand how to use math and visuals together, which is useful if I want to study anything involving design, tech, or creative fields.

**11. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
Knowing how to create and manipulate visuals can help in jobs like game design, app development, or any career that needs clear and appealing visual communication.
